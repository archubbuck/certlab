CertLab Platform Review – Notes & Observations
1. Login & Membership
• Login system works as expected.
• Must integrate membership check:
o Ensure system validates paid membership.
o Support for free trials (e.g., 7 days).
o Trial/upgrade features can be handled via 3rd-party integrations.
2. Dashboard & Navigation
• Clicking dashboard works, routes properly.
• Study paths (e.g., “Study CC,” “Study CC”) throw error: “Failed to create quiz.”
o Need placeholder messaging like “Coming soon.”
o Should support backfill content (books, generated pages, links to authored media).
3. Quizzes
• Quiz Generation:
o CC quiz generates 20 questions.
o Observation: longest answer tends to be correct.
▪ Psychometric issue – lowers difficulty.
▪ Needs data balancing for fair testability.
• Quiz Summary:
o Quick summary & detailed analysis work well (accuracy, speed, recommendations).
o Practice Quiz button inactive → needs activation.
• Review Answers:
o Displays correct answers & explanations.
o Bug: incorrect/correct flag alternates or mislabels answers.
o Must reliably show selected answer vs. correct answer.
4. Modes
• Study Mode:
o Advertised as unlimited Qs, immediate feedback, multiple certs, no mastery impact.
o Issue: feedback not shown per-question as expected (only after quiz).
• Quiz Mode:
o 25 questions, mastery meter should update.
o Flag for review option doesn’t function consistently.
o Needs clear behavior: flagged Qs should require resolution before submission.
• Practice Test Mode:
o Can start tests by cert, but “mixed practice session” unclear/inactive.
o Retake function fails (likely dummy content).
o Retake history should be accurate or hidden until implemented.
5. Scoring & Mastery
• Overall Mastery %:
o Currently static, not updating across modes.
• Domain Mastery Tracking:
o Promising feature – but no visible updates after multiple exams.
o Suggest threshold: after 5–10 exams, show progression.
6. Gamification
• Achievements:
o Good feature, adds engagement.
o Current thresholds (e.g., “High Achiever” after 5 sessions) may be too low.
o Recommend higher, configurable benchmarks (e.g., 25 sessions, 90%+ scores).
o Ensure system flexibility in configuring milestones.
7. Study Materials
• Current: placeholder/dummy.
• Options:
o Use authored books, online study guides, or video content.
o Build modular add-ons, phased rollout acceptable.
• Needs integration point for structured content.
8. Study Groups
• Feature promising, but currently non-functional:
o Chat & schedule links inactive.
o Group membership appears dummied.
• Recommendations:
o Limit group creation rights.
o Allow joining multiple groups.
o Consider phased rollout (v2 feature).
9. Tools & Admin
• Tools area currently exposes backend UI/structure → security concern.
• Restrict UI structure and admin dashboard access (should not be visible to all users).
• Account settings:
o Personalization (colors, profile pictures) desirable.
o Password resets handled by 3rd-party SSO, not internal.
10. General Impressions
• Platform looks strong and aligns with original vision.
• Primary gaps:
o Bug fixes (answer review, mastery tracking, flagging).
o Placeholder features should display “coming soon.”
o Functional links & content population needed.
• Phased approach acceptable:
o Core quiz engine stable.
o Study groups, mastery tracking, and study content can be v2.
Key Takeaway: CertLab is on the right path. Focus next on fixing quiz logic bugs, stabilizing mastery metrics, and gating unfinished features with “coming soon” messaging. Content population and study group/social features can follow once core functionality is reliable.
